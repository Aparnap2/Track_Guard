"""Co-founder Agent for Sarthi V3.0.

This module provides the manager layer that orchestrates Employee Agents:
- router.py: routes messages to employee agents
- reflector.py: reads founder response, converts to score
- curator.py: updates Graphiti playbook
- correlation.py: cross-signal detection + synthesis
- joint_council.py: Mantriparishad — cross-domain alert council
- arbiter.py: Nyayadish — inter-agent conflict resolution
